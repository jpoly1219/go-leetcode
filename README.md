# go-leetcode

A clone of Leetcode written in Go and Svelte.

## Backend written in Go
- Go is an amazing language that allows me to write fast and robust backend code.
- Go's ability to create concurrent programs with ease helps me with this project, as there are many users compiling and running/checking their code. None of this would be blocking, and the users won't have to wait around for their code to be uploaded and be compiled.
- Being a typed language, Go makes it easy for me to debug my code.
- Manual error handling is a lot better than I have expected. This allows me to pinpoint exactly where the error is in my code, and allows me to gracefully handle different types of errors.

## Frontend written in Svelte and TailwindCSS
- Svelte is an ideal option for a frontend because it allows me to create blazing fast frontend with a small footprint.
- TailwindCSS is awesome for quickly scaffolding good looking apps. While it does make the HTML elements a bit verbose, it is still the most intuitive way, in my opinion, to design each element and component.
